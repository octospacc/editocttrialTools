# Welcome to Docusaurus-Static!

Docusaurus-Static is a set made out of a build postprocessing script, and several static runtime files, that can be used to make any Docusaurus site magically work without a web server.

Not only can the built site be navigated as a collection of static HTML pages from `file:///` locations or indiscriminate domains, but is now also made to be contained in a single-file HTML application. Only if you're not already on it, try opening <a href="/docusaurus-static-single-file.html">docusaurus-static-single-file.html</a>...
