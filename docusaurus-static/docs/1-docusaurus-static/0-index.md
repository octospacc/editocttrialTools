# About Docusaurus-Static

This site, built with Docusaurus, doubles both as the demo for Docusaurus-Static, and new sites created with it, as well as a guide and documentation specific to Docusaurus-Static.

* Use the navigation menu to get to all the information, and to get a feel for how Docusaurus handles documentation.
* Check out the [blog](/blog) for some extra stuff that doesn't fit anywhere, and to experience how Docusaurus handles post pages.

## License

To keep thing simple, Docusaurus-Static is hereby licensed under the same terms as official Docusaurus:

* The code is [MIT licensed](https://gitlab.com/octospacc/editocttrialTools/-/blob/main/docusaurus-static/LICENSE)
* The documentation (e.g., `.md` files in the `/docs` folder) is [Creative Commons licensed](https://gitlab.com/octospacc/editocttrialTools/-/blob/main/docusaurus-static/LICENSE-docs)

With one possible exception, depending on legal interpretation, for the script `docusaurus-static-postprocess.js`: Licensing of this file is promiscuous, since the original this is based on has no license, but this has probably been transformed enough from the original that it could be licensed under the project's license (MIT). You are therefore advised to make your own judgement about the legal state of it. Note that this file is only needed for compilation, and isn't distributed in the site build output, so you could avoid worrying about redistribution rights/restrictions in some circumstances.
