# About Docusaurus-Static

This section will host documentation specific for Docusaurus-Static.

In the meantime, you can get started by **cloning the Git repo** and doing things the standard Docusaurus way, but remember to build your site with `npm run build+postprocess`. Also, check out the [blog](/blog).
