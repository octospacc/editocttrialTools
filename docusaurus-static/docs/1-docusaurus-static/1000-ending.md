# Thoughts and Credits

This proof-of-concept wouldn't have been possible without...
* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) itself, by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/), which I, like many others, hope will one day officially support what I'm trying to do here.
* The original [`postprocess.js` script](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/448#issuecomment-908777029), by [@ohkimur](https://github.com/ohkimur), from which my `docusaurus-static-postprocess.js` script is derived.
